# How to Use WZCook to Crack WiFi Passwords on Windows 7
 
WZCook is a small tool that can help you crack WiFi passwords on Windows 7. It works by capturing and analyzing the wireless packets sent by the router and the devices connected to it. WZCook can reveal the password of any WiFi network that uses WEP or WPA encryption, as long as you are within range of the signal.

In this article, we will show you how to use WZCook to crack WiFi passwords on Windows 7. You will need a wireless adapter that supports monitor mode and packet injection, such as Atheros, Broadcom, or Ralink chipsets. You will also need to download WZCook from [here](https://zhaodll.co/W/20130707/236010.html) [^1^] and extract it to a folder on your desktop.
 
## Step 1: Run WZCook as Administrator
 
Right-click on the WZCook.exe file and select "Run as administrator". You will see a command prompt window with some information about your wireless adapter and the available networks. If you get an error message saying "Fatal: Could not open service manager", try running WZCook in compatibility mode for Windows XP SP3.
 
## Step 2: Select the Target Network
 
WZCook will scan for nearby WiFi networks and display them in a list. Each network will have a number, a name (SSID), a channel, a signal strength (RSSI), and an encryption type (WEP or WPA). To select the target network, type its number and press Enter. For example, if you want to crack the password of the network named "Cyber Done", type "1" and press Enter.
 
## Step 3: Capture Packets
 
WZCook will start capturing packets from the target network and save them to a file named "wzcook.cap" in the same folder as WZCook.exe. You will see some statistics about the packets captured, such as the number of IVs (Initialization Vectors) for WEP networks or the number of handshakes for WPA networks. You will need at least 10,000 IVs for WEP networks or one handshake for WPA networks to crack the password.
 
## Step 4: Crack the Password
 
Once you have enough packets captured, you can stop WZCook by pressing Ctrl+C. Then, you can use another tool called Aircrack-ng to crack the password from the wzcook.cap file. You can download Aircrack-ng from [here](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/) [^2^] and install it on your Windows 7 system.
 
To crack the password of a WEP network, open a command prompt window and navigate to the folder where you installed Aircrack-ng. Then, type this command:
 `aircrack-ng -b [BSSID] wzcook.cap` 
Replace [BSSID] with the MAC address of the target router, which you can find in the output of WZCook. For example:
 `aircrack-ng -b 00:11:22:33:44:55 wzcook.cap` 
Aircrack-ng will try to find the key from the IVs captured by WZCook. If successful, it will display the key in hexadecimal format. For example:
 `KEY FOUND! [ AA:BB:CC:DD:EE ]` 
To crack the password of a WPA network, open a command prompt window and navigate to the folder where you installed Aircrack-ng. Then, type this command:
 `aircrack-ng -w [wordlist] -b [BSSID] wzcook.cap` 
Replace [wordlist] with the path to a file that contains a list of possible passwords, such as rockyou.txt or darkc0de.lst. You can download some wordlists from [here](https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt)
