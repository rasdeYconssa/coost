Äavolja nevjesta is a classic example of a Regency romance, set in England in the early 19th century. The book is full of witty dialogue, sensual scenes, and intriguing characters. Laurens creates a vivid picture of the aristocratic world, with its balls, duels, scandals, and intrigues. She also adds a touch of suspense and mystery to the plot, as Honoria and Devil try to find out who killed Devil's cousin and why. The book is well-written and engaging, with a fast-paced and satisfying story.
 
The main attraction of the book is the relationship between Honoria and Devil, who are both strong-willed and independent. They have a lot of chemistry and banter, as they challenge each other and clash over their different views on life and love. Honoria is a modern heroine, who values her freedom and adventure over marriage and security. She is not afraid to stand up to Devil or anyone else who tries to control her. Devil is a typical alpha male hero, who is arrogant, dominant, and protective. He is used to getting his way and having women fall at his feet. He is also loyal, brave, and honorable. He is determined to make Honoria his wife, even if he has to seduce her or kidnap her.

He is also the cousin of her new employer, who has just been murdered. Devil suspects that Honoria might be involved in the murder, and decides to keep her with him until he can clear her name. He also feels a strong attraction to her, and decides to make her his bride.
 
Another memorable scene is when Honoria and Devil attend a ball at his family's estate. Honoria is reluctant to go, but Devil insists that she needs to be introduced to society as his future wife. He also wants to show her off to his family and friends, who are curious about the woman who has captured his heart.

However, she also faces some hostility and jealousy from some of Devil's former lovers, who try to sabotage their happiness.
